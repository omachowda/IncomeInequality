# Income Inequality

## Abstract

This study uses demographic variables from US census data to predict income in counties across the US. The motivation behind predicting income is to see if there are any Income Inequalties that stem from these demographics that could be used as part of social movemements towards income equality. We fit many variable selection regression models to narrow down our models to the most significant variables, using RMSE as an indicator of model accuracy. After testing all our models, we found that a polynomial regression gave the best results and omitted enough variables to make the model interpretable. We concluded that demographic variables are significant when predicting income, and that there is some evidence of income inquality when it comes to gender and race.
